  <title>Profile Data Management</title>

  <para>ParaProf uses <firstterm>PerfDMF</firstterm> to manage profile
  data.  This enables it to read the various profile formats as well as
  store and retrieve them from a database.</para>

  <sect1 id="paraprof.mainwindow">

    <title>ParaProf Manager Window</title>
    <para>Upon launching ParaProf, the user is greeted with the ParaProf Manager Window.</para>

    <para>This window is used to manage profile data.  The user can
      upload/download profile data, edit meta-data, launch visual displays,
      export data, derive new metrics, etc.
    </para>

  <sect1 id="paraprof.loading">
    <title>Loading Profiles</title> 

    <para>To load profile data, select File->Open, or right click on the
    Application's tree and select "Add Trial".
    </para>

    <para>Select the type of data from the "Trial Type" drop-down box.  For TAU
    Profiles, select a directory, for other types, files.
    </para>
  </sect1>


  <sect1 id="paraprof.database">
    <title>Database Interaction</title> 

    <para>
      Database interaction is done through the tree view of the ParaProf
      Manager Window.  Applications expand to Experiments, Experiments to
      Trials, and Trials are loaded directly into ParaProf just as if they were
      read off disk.  Additionally, the meta-data associated with each element
      is show on the right, as in <xref linkend="paraprof.mainwindow.figure"
      />.  A trial can be exported by right clicking on it and selecting
      "Export as Packed Profile".
    </para>

    <para>
      New trials can be uploaded to the database by either right-clicking on an
      entity in the database and selecting "Add Trial", or by right-clicking
      on an Application/Experiment/Trial hierarchy from the "Standard
      Applications" and selecting "Upload Application/Experiment/Trial to DB".
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="paraprof.derivedmetrics">
    <title>Creating Derived Metrics</title>

    <para>ParaProf can created derived metrics using the <emphasis>Derived
	Metric Panel</emphasis>, available from the <emphasis>Options</emphasis>
      menu of the ParaProf Manager Window.
    </para>


    <figure id="paraprof.derivedmetrics.figure"> <title>Creating Derived Metrics</title>

    </figure>

    <para>In <xref linkend="paraprof.derivedmetrics.figure"/>, we have just
      divided Floating Point Instructions by Wall-clock time, creating FLOPS
      (Floating Point Operations per Second).  The 2nd argument is a user
      editable text-box and can be filled in with scalar values by using the
      keyword 'val' (e.g. "val 1.5").
    </para>
  </sect1>

  
  <sect1 id="paraprof.maindatawindow">

    <title>Main Data Window</title> 

      <para>Upon loading a profile, or double-clicking on a metric, the
        <firstterm>Main Data Window</firstterm> will be displayed.</para>

    <figure id="paraprof.maindatawindow.figure"> <title>Main Data Window</title>
      <mediaobject>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>This window shows each thread as well as statistics as a combined bar
      graph.  Each function is represented by a different color (though
      possibly cycled).  From anywhere in ParaProf, you can right-click on
      objects representing threads or functions to launch displays associated
      with those objects.  For example, in <xref
      linkend="paraprof.maindatawindow.figure"/>, right click on the text
      <emphasis>n,c,t, 8,0,0</emphasis> to launch thread based displays for
      node 8.
    </para>

    <figure> <title>Unstacked Bars</title>
      <mediaobject>
	<imageobject><imagedata fileref="unstacked.gif" scalefit="0"
		       width="4.8in" align="center"/></imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <para>
      You may also turn off the stacking of bars so that individual functions
      can be compared across threads in a global display.
    </para>
