<chapter id="InstallPerfExplorer">
    <title>Installation and Configuration</title>

        <para>PerfExplorer uses TAUdb and PerfDMF databases so if you have not already you
        will need to install TAUdb, see <xref linkend="taudb.intro"/>.

        After installing and configuring TAU the perfexplorer executable should be available
        in your <literal>[path to tau]/tau2/[arch]/bin</literal> directory. You will
        need to run <literal>perfexplorer_configure</literal>, installed at the same location as perfexplorer,
        to set up your database for use with perfexplorer and to download additional 3rd party
        jar files perfexplorer requires. When prompted by <literal>perfexplorer_configure</literal>
        give the name of your PerfDMF or TAUdb database and press Y to agree
        to download the jar files.
