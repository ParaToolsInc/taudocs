TAU Performance SystemÂ® is a portable profiling and tracing toolkit for
performance analysis of parallel programs written in Fortran, C, C++,
Java, and Python. TAU (Tuning and Analysis Utilities) is capable of
gathering performance information through instrumentation of functions,
methods, basic blocks, and statements. The TAU API also provides
selection of profiling groups for organizing and controlling
instrumentation. Calls to the TAU API are made by probes inserted into
the execution of the application via source transformation, compiler
directives or by library interposition.

This guide is organized into different sections. Readers wanting to get
started right way can skip to the `Common Profile
Requests <#ApplicationScenario>`__ section for step-by-step instructions
for obtaining difference kinds of performance data. Or browse the
`starters guide <#StartersGuide>`__ for a quick reference to common TAU
commands and variables.
