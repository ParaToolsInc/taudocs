Running PerfExplorer
====================

To run PerfExplorer type:

::

    %>perfexplorer

When PerfExplorer loads you will see on the left window all the
experiments that where loaded into PerfDMF. You can select which
performance data you are interested by navigating the tree structure.
PerfExplorer will allow you to run analysis operations on these
experiments. Also the cluster analysis results are visible on the right
side of the window. Various types of comparative analysis are available
from the drop down menu selected.

To run an analysis operation, first select the metric of interest form
the experiments on the left. Then perform the operation by selecting it
from the ``Analysis`` menu. If you would like you can set the
`` clustering method, dimension reduction, normalization method
        `` and the `` number of clusters ``\ from the same menu.

The options under the Charts menu provide analysis over one or more
applications, experiments, views or trials. To view these charts first
choose a metric of interest by selecting a trial form the tree on the
left. Then optionally choose the ``Set Metric of
        Interest`` or ``Set Event of Interest`` form the ``Charts`` menu
(if you don't, and you need to, you will be prompted). Now you can view
a chart by selecting it from the ``Charts`` menu.
