Charts
======

Setting Parameters
==================

There are a few parameters which need to be set when doing comparisons
between trials in the database. If any necessary setting is not
configured before requesting a chart, you will be prompted to set the
value. The following settings may be necessary for the various charts
available:

Group of Interest
-----------------

TAU events are often associated with common groups, such as "MPI",
"TRANSPOSE", etc. This value is used for showing what fraction of
runtime that this group of events contributed to the total runtime.

|Setting Group of Interest|

Metric of Interest
------------------

Profiles may contain many metrics gathered for a single trial. This
selects which of the available metrics the user is interested in.

|Setting Metric of Interest|

Event of Interest
-----------------

Some charts examine events in isolation. This setting configures which
event to examine.

|Setting Event of Interest|

Total Number of Timesteps
-------------------------

One chart, the "Timesteps per second" chart, will calculate the number
of timesteps completed per second. This setting configures that value.

|Setting Timesteps|

Standard Chart Types
====================

Timesteps Per Second
--------------------

The Timesteps Per Second chart shows how an application scales as it
relates to time-to-solution. If the timesteps are not already set, you
will be prompted to enter the total number of timesteps in the trial
(see ? ). If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be
prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To request this
chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart
item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Timesteps per Second|

Relative Efficiency
-------------------

The Relative Efficiency chart shows how an application scales with
respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the number of processors
increases by a factor, the time to solution is expected to decrease by
the same factor (with ideal scaling). The fraction between the expected
scaling and the actual scaling is the relative efficiency. If there is
more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the
metric of interest (see ?). To request this chart, select one experiment
or view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Efficiency|

Relative Efficiency by Event
----------------------------

The Relative Efficiency By Event chart shows how each event in an
application scales with respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the
number of processors increases by a factor, the time to solution is
expected to decrease by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The
fraction between the expected scaling and the actual scaling is the
relative efficiency. If there is more than one metric to choose from,
you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To request
this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this
chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Efficiency by Event|

Relative Efficiency for One Event
---------------------------------

The Relative Efficiency for One Event chart shows how one event from an
application scales with respect to relative efficiency. That is, as the
number of processors increases by a factor, the time to solution is
expected to decrease by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The
fraction between the expected scaling and the actual scaling is the
relative efficiency. If there is more than one event to choose from, and
you have not yet selected an event of interest, you may be prompted to
select the event of interest (see ?). If there is more than one metric
to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest
(see ?). To request this chart, select one or more experiments or one
view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Efficiency one Event|

Relative Speedup
----------------

The Relative Speedup chart shows how an application scales with respect
to relative speedup. That is, as the number of processors increases by a
factor, the speedup is expected to increase by the same factor (with
ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is charted, along with the actual
speedup for the application. If there is more than one metric to choose
from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To
request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and
select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Speedup|

Relative Speedup by Event
-------------------------

The Relative Speedup By Event chart shows how the events in an
application scale with respect to relative speedup. That is, as the
number of processors increases by a factor, the speedup is expected to
increase by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is
charted, along with the actual speedup for the application. If there is
more than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the
metric of interest (see ?). To request this chart, select one experiment
or view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Speedup by Event|

Relative Speedup for One Event
------------------------------

The Relative Speedup for One Event chart shows how one event in an
application scales with respect to relative speedup. That is, as the
number of processors increases by a factor, the speedup is expected to
increase by the same factor (with ideal scaling). The ideal speedup is
charted, along with the actual speedup for the application. If there is
more than one event to choose from, and you have not yet selected an
event of interest, you may be prompted to select the event of interest
(see ?). If there is more than one metric to choose from, you may be
prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To request this
chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and select this chart
item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Speedup one Event|

Group % of Total Runtime
------------------------

The Group % of Total Runtime chart shows how the fraction of the total
runtime for one group of events changes as the number of processors
increases. If there is more than one group to choose from, and you have
not yet selected a group of interest, you may be prompted to select the
group of interest (see ?). If there is more than one metric to choose
from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To
request this chart, select one or more experiments or one view, and
select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Group % of Total Runtime|

Runtime Breakdown
-----------------

The Runtime Breakdown chart shows the fraction of the total runtime for
all events in the application, and how the fraction changes as the
number of processors increases. If there is more than one metric to
choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see
?). To request this chart, select one experiment or view, and select
this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Runtime Breakdown|

Phase Chart Types
=================

TAU now provides the ability to break down profiles with respect to
phases of execution. One such application would be to collect separate
statistics for each timestep, or group of timesteps. In order to
visualize the variance between the phases of execution, a number of
phase-based charts are available.

Relative Efficiency per Phase
-----------------------------

The Relative Efficiency Per Phase chart shows the relative efficiency
for each phase, as the number of processors increases. If there is more
than one metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric
of interest (see ?). To request this chart, select one experiment or
view, and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Efficiency per Phase|

Relative Speedup per Phase
--------------------------

The Relative Speedup Per Phase chart shows the relative speedup for each
phase, as the number of processors increases. If there is more than one
metric to choose from, you may be prompted to select the metric of
interest (see ?). To request this chart, select one experiment or view,
and select this chart item under the "Charts" main menu item.

|Relative Speedup per Phase|

Phase Fraction of Total Runtime
-------------------------------

The Phase Fraction of Total Runtime chart shows the breakdown of the
execution by phases, and shows how that breakdown changes as the number
of processors increases. If there is more than one metric to choose
from, you may be prompted to select the metric of interest (see ?). To
request this chart, select one experiment or view, and select this chart
item under the "Charts" main menu item.
