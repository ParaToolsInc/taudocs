		<para>There are a few parameters which need to be set when
		doing comparisons between trials in the database.  If any
		necessary setting is not configured before requesting a
		chart, you will be prompted to set the value.  The following
		settings may be necessary for the various charts available:
		</para>
		<sect2 id="GroupOfInterest">
		<title>Group of Interest</title>
		<para>TAU events are often associated with common groups,
		such as "MPI", "TRANSPOSE", etc.  This value is used for
		showing what fraction of runtime that this group of
		events contributed to the total runtime.</para>

		<para>The Timesteps Per Second chart shows how an application
		scales as it relates to time-to-solution.  If the timesteps are
		not already set, you will be prompted to enter the total number
		of timesteps in the trial (see <xref
