        <para>To run PerfExplorer type: <screen>
%>perfexplorer
</screen>

        When PerfExplorer loads you will see on the left window all the 
        experiments that where loaded into PerfDMF. You can select which 
        performance data you are interested by navigating the tree structure. 
        PerfExplorer will allow you to 
        run analysis operations on these experiments. Also the cluster analysis
        results are visible on the right side of the window.  Various types of
        comparative analysis are available from the drop down menu
        selected.</para>

        <para>To run an analysis operation, first select the metric of interest
        form the experiments on the left. Then perform the operation by selecting it
        from the <literal>Analysis</literal> menu. If you would like you can set 
        the <literal> clustering method, dimension reduction, normalization method
		</literal> and the <literal> number of clusters </literal>from the same
		menu.</para>

		<para>The options under the Charts menu provide analysis over one or
		more applications, experiments, views or trials. To view these charts
		first choose a metric of interest by selecting a trial form the tree on
		the left. Then optionally choose the <literal>Set Metric of
        Interest</literal> or <literal>Set Event of Interest</literal> form the 
        <literal>Charts</literal> menu (if you don't, and you need to, you will
		be prompted). Now you can view a chart by selecting it
        from the <literal>Charts</literal> menu.</para>
